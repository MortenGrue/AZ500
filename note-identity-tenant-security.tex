\subsubsection{Azure Tenants}
\textbf{Transferring subscriptions} \\
It is possible to transfer a subscription to another tenant, this will remove all role-based access control (RBAC) assignments to manage resources in the original subscription. It is also possible to transfer just the billing ownership of an account, without moving the subscription to the new accounts tenant - this is done by unchecking the box for Subscription Azure AD.

\textbf{External developer account} \\
It is possible to enable access to the developer portal for users from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This is intended to provide access for external developers and this feature is available in the Premium, Standard and Developer tiers of API Management.
